Port Forwarding:

It is recommended to install bubbledns under it's own username without giving root rights. Therefore it can not open port under 1024.
It might not be the best way, but I just routed port 53 to port 5300 and let the server listen on that port.

To do this:
1. Install necessary program (Iptable commands are not persistent on it's own)
	sudo apt install iptables-persistent
2. Route UDP 53 to 5300 and make it persistent
	sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5300
	sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
3. That's it

The whole installation will be avaiable later.
If you have any questions, write them on Github.
